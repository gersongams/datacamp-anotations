    "Out of the box, Python offers a bunch of built-in functions to make your life as a data scientist easier. You already know two such functions: [`print()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print) and [`type()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#type). You've also used the functions [`str()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-str), [`int()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int), [`bool()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool) and [`float()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float) to switch between data types. These are built-in functions as well.\n",
