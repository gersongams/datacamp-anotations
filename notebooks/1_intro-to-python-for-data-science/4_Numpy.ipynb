    "If your 2D `numpy` array has a regular structure, i.e. each row and column has a fixed number of values, complicated ways of subsetting become very easy. Have a look at the code below where the elements `\"a\"` and `\"c\"` are extracted from a list of lists.\n",

    "The code that converts the pre-loaded `baseball` list to a 2D `numpy` array is already in the script. The first column contains the players' height in inches and the second column holds player weight, in pounds. Add some lines to make the correct selections. Remember that in Python, the first element is at index 0!"
